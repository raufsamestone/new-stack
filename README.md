## Using

The Go script is implementing a simple CRUD API for managing products.
It connects to a MySQL database using the database/sql package and the github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql driver.
It uses the Gin framework to handle HTTP requests and responses, and defines five routes for handling CRUD operations on products:

- GET: `/products` to retrieve all products,
- GET `/products/:productId` to retrieve a single product by ID,
- POST `/products` to create a new product,
- PUT `/products/:productId` to update an existing product, and
- DELETE `/products/:productId` to delete a product by ID.
